        "      In Python, \"dunder\" methods, also known as magic or special methods, are methods with names prefixed and suffixed by double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__) that allow you to define custom behavior for built-in operations and operators.\n",

Static methods, on the other hand, do not have access to the class object and cannot modify any class-level attributes.\n",

        "      -;In Python, while the term \"method overloading\" is often used, it's not implemented in the way it is in languages like Java or C++.

        "\n",
        "  12.  What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "      -;In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass, enabling customized behavior while maintaining the same method signature.\n",

        "      14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "         -;Polymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility by allowing different objects to respond to the same message in their own unique ways, promoting a more adaptable and maintainable software design.\n",

        "    15. What is an abstract class in Python+\n",

        "          Class variables are defined within the class but outside of any class methods. Instance variables are defined within class methods, typically the constructor. Changes made to the class variable affect all instances. Changes made to the instance variable does not affect all instances.\n",

        "      20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python+\n",

        "             22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "              -; In Python, @classmethod defines a method that receives the class itself as its first argument (cls), allowing access to class attributes, while @staticmethod defines a method that doesn't receive any implicit arguments and is essentially a regular function within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "        23.   How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "             -; In Python, polymorphism with inheritance works through method overriding, where a child class redefines a method inherited from its parent class, allowing the same method name to have different behaviors based on the object's class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "             24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP+\n",
        "               -; In Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), method chaining allows you to call multiple methods sequentially on the same object, in a single line of code, by having each method return the object itself (or a derived version of it).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "               25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python\n",
        "                 -; __call__() is to turn your instances into callable objects. In other words, its purpose is to create objects that you can call as you would call a regular function. Most Python classes don't implement this method. Your custom classes will have it only if you need to use your instances as functions.\n",
